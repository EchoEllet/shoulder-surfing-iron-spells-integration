# Shoulder Surfing: Iron's Spells Integration

A simple client-side mod that integrates [Shoulder Surfing Reloaded](https://modrinth.com/mod/shoulder-surfing-reloaded)
and [Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks), making the camera automatically
follow your crosshair whenever you cast a spellâ€”via spellbooks, normal spells, or quick cast. Compatible with controller
mods.
